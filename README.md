<h1 align="center" > Transformer Based Hierarchical Model for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Detection & Classification </h1>

<p align='justify'>
The second most prevalent cancer in the world, lung cancer, leads to all other cancers in terms of mortality. The delay in diagnosis, which affects the prognosis and therapy, is one of the leading causes of lung cancer deaths. In order to help pathologists, researchers suggest artificial intelligence-based approaches. We have also attempted to contribute to this noble cause by putting up a unique model for identifying and categorizing non-small cell lung cancer, which is the most prevalent cancer among the other lung cancer types. Our proposed model can detect and classify three types of NSCLC: normal, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. </p>
